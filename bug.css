The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a `width` property might not work as expected if the parent container's width is not explicitly defined or is itself dynamic.  Another example is incorrectly nesting `calc()` expressions, resulting in parsing errors.
